This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

Aproach 1 -
- multiply all numbers in array in 1 loop
- create 2nd array with the product of all in all positions i.e same number
- loop again, this time, divide the 2nd array elements with 1st array elements

Approach 2 - 
- use two cascaded loops (1st element with all the elements, 2nd element with all the elements etc)
- multiply all in 2nd loop, except the indices matching with 1st loop's current element 
& store the products in seperate array

Corner cases -

1. array should have all non-zero values
