Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
 

Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Solving trick:

There are only 4 possible conditions for some of digits-
- sum = 0; set sum = 0, carryforward = 0
- sum = 1; set sum = 1, carryforward = 1
- sum = 2; set sum = 0, carryforward = 1
- sum = 3; set sum = 1, carryforward = 1
#sum can't exceed more than 3
