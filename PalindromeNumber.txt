Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

Approach1-
1. Convert int into string
2. apply loop on each character of string with two variables, i = 0 & j = string.length, i++ & j--
3. run loop till i == j (both come to the middle character), compare each string[i] with string[j]
4. if the comparison returns false then break through the loop else return false

Approach2-  right
or instead of using loop the complicated way, I can use reverse loop only once to reverse the string,
& store it in a new variable & check if both are equal

note: for using loop in reverse, make sure to use 3rd parameter i.e. decrement
eg: for i in range(len(str)-1,-1,-1)
